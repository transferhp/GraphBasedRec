This is a Python project for implementing the algorithm
'Top-N Recommendation on Graphs', which is proposed by:
Zhao Kang, Chong Peng, Ming Yang and Qiang Cheng in CIKM 2016.

In my implementation, I only used FlimTrust (http://www.librec.net/datasets.html)
as example dataset to run the Dual-graph recommendation model.
If you want to see more details about the algorithm,
please go to check the original paper:
